## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scalable RAG app for my friends doing their studies. And also a streaming chatbot with TTS (if that somehow works on my end huh)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning DevOps and looking into MLOps afterwards to adopt the best practices for creating an app. Might need to brush up on the Frontend too.
